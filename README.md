# TaleToon
The TaleToon project focuses on building a system that converts culturally relevant information into highly engaging comic-styled narra
tives. The core idea of the project is to blend storytelling techniques with
visual presentation in order to make learning more interactive, intuitive,
and appealing to the present generation. The project specifically tar
gets Indian festivals and traditions, thereby preserving cultural integrity
while presenting information in a structured and visually interpretable
format.
The system processes cultural texts through multiple intelligent
stages, beginning with the retrieval of relevant information from cu
rated cultural sources based on user inputs. The extracted information
is transformed into a concise and organized narrative that emphasizes
storytelling rather than purely descriptive content. The ultimate objec
tive of the project is to utilize these narratives to generate comic strips
with corresponding visual representations, resulting in a complete visual
storytelling framework
